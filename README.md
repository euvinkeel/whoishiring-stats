# whoishiring-stats

A web project that scrapes the monthly hackernews "Who is hiring?" posts, aggregates every post's technologies, locations, salaries, etc. and displays statistics based on the selected date range (in months).

It's also my first attempt at actually finishing + hosting a web project using Svelte, SvelteKit, Typescript, Tailwind.
